    "Scikit-learn was initially developed by **David Cournapeau** as a Google summer of code project in 2007.\n",
    "\n",
    "Later **Matthieu Brucher** joined the project and started to use it as apart of his thesis work. In 2010 *INRIA* got involved and the first public release (v0.1 beta) was published in late January 2010.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project now has more than 30 active contributors and has had paid sponsorship from INRIA, Google, Tinyclues and the Python Software Foundation."

    "## What is scikit-learn?\n",
    "Scikit-learn provides a range of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms via a consistent interface in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is licensed under a permissive simplified BSD license and is distributed under many Linux distributions, encouraging academic and commercial use.\n",
    "\n",
    "The library is built upon the ***SciPy (Scientific Python)*** that must be installed before you can use scikit-learn. This stack that includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **NumPy**: Base n-dimensional array package\n",
    "- **SciPy**: Fundamental library for scientific computing\n",
    "- **Matplotlib**: Comprehensive 2D/3D plotting\n",
    "- **IPython**: Enhanced interactive console\n",
    "- **Sympy**: Symbolic mathematics\n",
    "- **Pandas**: Data structures and analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Extensions or modules for SciPy care conventionally named SciKits. As such, the module provides learning algorithms and is named scikit-learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "The vision for the library is a level of robustness and support required for use in production systems. This means a deep focus on concerns such as easy of use, code quality, collaboration, documentation and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the interface is Python, c-libraries are leverage for performance such as numpy for arrays and matrix operations, LAPACK, LibSVM and the careful use of cython."
